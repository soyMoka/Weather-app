# Stardw Valley Weather app 
Made with React and Redux

## Description

This is a weather app made with two diferent APIs from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) ( [Current weather data](https://openweathermap.org/current) and [Geocoding API](https://openweathermap.org/api/geocoding-api)) mostly based on the old [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQyCNoWrZik) of iNovotek.

## Objetives
I started this project as a first contact with redux. 

The API used in the tutorial that I was following has changed, and I had to use two diferent APIs to mantain the same functionality.

I made it with a [Stardw Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/) style because potato.
